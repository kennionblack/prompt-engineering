# Week 2: Chatbots galore

## Executive Summary

## Worklog

<!-- Note that this "table" was mostly generated with a VSCode extension that attempts to make all markdown table cells the same size, hence the strange formatting. I strongly recommend reading this report with something that actually renders the markdown instead of attempting to parse this mess visually. -->

## Exercises

On a suggestion from lecture, I decided to make a visualization for why AI is bad at generating random numbers. The code for this can be seen in `rand_distribution_generator.py` with the output distribution visible in `distribution.png`. Note: a bigger sample size than 100 would likely emphasize even more how AI-generated "random" isn't really random, but I'd rather not blow through my tokens all in one go. Also, I may do this exercise again later in the semester with a tool call to show how using actual code within the AI reasoning process can improve accuracy.

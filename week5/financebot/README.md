                                  ‚Üê‚Üí Future: Alpaca Trading API
                                  ‚Üê‚Üí Future: Portfolio Management Server
                                  ‚Üê‚Üí Future: Economic Data Server
```

```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode (watch for changes)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start

# Format code
npm run format

# Type checking
npm run check
```

### Adding New MCP Servers

1. Install the MCP server in the `mcp-servers/` directory
2. Add configuration to the `mcpServers` array in `index.ts`
3. Update environment variables as needed
4. Test the integration with the new tools

### Extending Financial Tools

Add new tools to `finance-tools.ts`:

```typescript
private createNewFinanceTool() {
  return tool({
    description: 'Description of your new financial tool',
    inputSchema: z.object({
      parameter: z.number().describe('Parameter description'),
    }),
    execute: async ({ parameter }) => {
      // Your calculation logic
      return JSON.stringify(result, null, 2);
    },
  });
}
```

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues

**Error: "Yahoo Finance MCP server not available"**

Open-Source Tools for AI Agents with Code Execution Sandboxes

Enhanced AI Agents: Integrating Code as a Reasoning Tool
AI agents can gain powerful new capabilities by treating code generation and execution as part of their reasoning loop. Certain problems – especially those that are computational, combinatorial, or algorithmic – are naturally solved by writing and running code. For example, mathematical puzzles, optimization tasks (like the traveling salesman problem or knapsack), and data analysis questions benefit from precise calculation or systematic search that code excels at. Indeed, experiments show that LLMs using a “code interpreter” tool yield significantly better accuracy on multi-step reasoning benchmarks (e.g. Humanity’s Last Exam) than using text alone. Similarly, a recent AI-agent system (OR-LLM-Agent) solved complex operations-research problems by converting them into mathematical models and running Python solver code – achieving a 100% pass rate on a set of test problems. In general, tasks requiring exact arithmetic, exhaustive search, or formal algorithms are well-suited to code solutions, whereas highly creative, subjective, or purely linguistic tasks may not benefit from code. Teaching the AI to recognize the difference can come from prompt signals (e.g. “write a program to compute…”), or by monitoring uncertainty: when an LLM is unsure or needs verification, it can “think by coding” instead of guessing from memory.
Teaching the AI to Think in Code
To make an agent deliberately use code in its reasoning, one can incorporate chain-of-thought with code prompts and planning. For instance, the agent could first outline a multi-step plan (“Step 1: parse input; Step 2: run algorithm X; Step 3: return result”), then implement each step in code. This “self-planning” approach is known to improve structured reasoning and code synthesis: one study had the model first list high-level solution steps, then generate Python code for each, effectively decomposing a complex task into manageable subproblems. In practice, a system could prompt the LLM for an outline (in natural language or pseudocode), then prompt again for the actual code. LLMs can also be fine-tuned or prompted to treat function calls or APIs as tools (for example, by giving them Python function signatures in the prompt) so they naturally write code that uses those functions. Providing examples or system instructions that emphasize “solve by writing and running code” can bias the model toward coding solutions. Modern models already show this tendency: for instance, Cloudflare’s experiments found that giving an LLM a set of API tools as TypeScript functions and asking it to write code to call them led to more successful multi-step tool use than having the model call those tools directly. Once coding is in the pipeline, we need an iterative feedback loop. The agent can generate code, run it, then inspect the output or error messages. If the code crashes or produces wrong results, the LLM can be prompted to self-repair the code, using the error log or test failures as clues. This idea of “generate–execute–fix” has been validated in systems like OR-LLM-Agent: after generating solver code, it executes it in a sandbox; if a runtime error occurs, the agent rewrites the code using the error message. A few repair attempts may suffice, and if still no correct solution, the agent can even self-verify its underlying logic (for example, checking its math model and regenerating code). These self-reflection steps (self-repair, static analysis, and verification) greatly boost reliability. For example, techniques like “ROCODE” continuously monitor compilation or linting errors, then trigger targeted rewrites of the minimal faulty code segment. In a prototyping environment, we would similarly use linters, unit tests, or language-server warnings as part of the loop: the agent writes code, a static checker or test suite analyzes it, and the agent refines the code until it passes all checks.
Decompose problems as functions: Encourage the agent to treat sub-tasks as separate functions with clear inputs/outputs. E.g., ask “write a function that takes X and returns Y.” This modular approach isolates problems and makes debugging easier.
Iterative debugging: After each code generation, run the code in a sandbox. Capture any errors or incorrect outputs. Feed these back to the LLM in context, prompting it to fix the code (as OR-LLM’s “self-repair” loop).
Static analysis and linters: Integrate tools (like a Python linter or type checker) to catch syntax/style issues early. For instance, a system might run flake8 or mypy in the sandbox and append warnings to the context, guiding the LLM’s next iteration.
Evaluation agent: Optionally, use a second LLM or a set of predefined tests to evaluate code quality, not just correctness. The second agent can review the code (or its output) and suggest improvements or catch logical errors, creating a negotiation loop (as seen in “CodeVisionary” evaluation framework).
Whether to orchestrate code via functional calls or by building classes depends on the task’s nature. Function chaining is generally simpler for pipelines of discrete steps: write a main script that calls helper functions (or external tool-API functions) in sequence. Cloudflare’s “code mode” shows that tasks involving multiple tools are easier if the LLM simply writes code to call those tools in order, rather than outputting each tool call individually. Classes might be useful if you have a complex, stateful simulation or reusable objects (for instance, a class representing a graph or a machine-learning model). In many cases, starting with simple stateless functions is best; you can always refactor into classes if needed. The key is that each code snippet should work together: either import or call other snippets as functions, or merge them into one program before execution. Empirically, treating tools/modules as functions in code (rather than juggling them through chat messages) tends to reduce overhead and token usage.
When to Use Code vs. Language
Not all questions merit a coding solution. As a rule of thumb, algorithmic or optimization problems, numerical computations, and data transformations are great candidates for code. If a question is about implementing a precise procedure (like “find the shortest route” or “sort a list of items by some criteria”), writing a program is natural. On the other hand, tasks that rely on common-sense reasoning, analogies, or creative explanation might be better answered in plain language. The agent can be trained or prompted to assess the question: for example, if it recognizes keywords like “compute,” “find all solutions,” or “simulate,” it should consider coding. It could also attempt a fast natural-language answer first; if that answer is uncertain or unsatisfactory, switch to a coding approach for verification. This decision process can be built into the prompt or system logic. Importantly, giving the model access to code generation tools (as in OpenAI’s Code Interpreter) has been shown to improve its performance on mathematical and complex problems, suggesting that whenever exact computation or multi-step calculation is needed, using code is often beneficial.
Integrating Live Information and Tools
To leverage up-to-date knowledge and specialized info, the agent should incorporate external tools beyond code execution. A web-search or documentation lookup tool can let the AI fetch fresh data (e.g. the latest library functions or examples). In practice, this means wiring in APIs (like a web search API or a StackOverflow query API) that the LLM can call. Retrieval-augmented methods are useful: for instance, the agent might use a search tool to find relevant code snippets or library docs before writing code, reducing reliance on its training-time cache. Research shows LLMs can be taught to call such tools automatically (as in Toolformer-based approaches). In one survey, a “CodeAgent” used tools for website search and documentation reading, symbol navigation, format checking, and even a built-in code interpreter, all orchestrated by the LLM. You can apply the same principle: give the agent access to e.g. Google Search or GitHub Code Search as a function call. The agent might first query “Python shortest path example” and then use the retrieved snippet as context. The open standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) and “tool-calling” interfaces in modern APIs facilitate this sort of integration. By trusting live data, the agent avoids outdated answers – a major limitation noted in evaluations, where LLMs lacked knowledge of the latest languages or library features without external tools. In summary, the agent’s prompt or system should allow and encourage using search/documentation tools when solving unfamiliar or up-to-date problems.
Secure and Efficient Code Sandboxing
Executing arbitrary code requires strict isolation and resource control. A common solution is to use Docker containers or similar sandboxes for each code execution. For a prototype, you can run each snippet in a fresh Docker container (with appropriate base images for each language). Open-source tools like LLM Sandbox already provide frameworks to do this securely. LLM Sandbox, for example, supports isolated execution of Python, JavaScript/Node, Java, C++, Go, R, etc., with automatic dependency installation and resource limits. This matches the user’s idea of multi-language environments. The containers should forbid network and file access unless explicitly needed, to keep execution safe. Depending on your needs, you could reuse the same container for iterative runs on the same question (to keep scratch files or state), but use separate new containers for different user queries (to avoid cross-talk). Tools like Python’s uuid module and container orchestrators can manage multiple sessions. To speed things up, preload images with common libraries (e.g. a Python image with NumPy/Pandas) so you don’t reinstall on every run. LLM Sandbox even has a “fast production mode” to reuse environments. For low-latency prototype work, you might keep a small pool of warm containers ready (like pre-warmed AWS Lambda) so that each code execution starts almost immediately. If statefulness is needed (e.g. the user uploads a data file), your environment can mount a volume or copy the data into the container for the run. The sandbox framework should let the LLM pass or retrieve files to/from the container. Alternative sandboxing technologies can also be considered: Google’s gVisor or nsjail provide stronger isolation (by intercepting syscalls), and WebAssembly (WASM) runtimes can execute code in a very lightweight sandbox – though WASM currently supports languages like C/C++ and Rust more easily than Python. Cloudflare’s “code mode” uses JavaScript V8 isolates to run user code, achieving very fast startup, but that only works for JavaScript currently. For a Python-centric project, Docker or a Python-native sandbox (like Pyodide or Jupyter in a controlled env) is simplest. Crucially, the environment should mimic the final deployment as much as possible so that code behavior is predictable. If scaling becomes an issue, you could auto-scale container workers (using Kubernetes or even simple Docker Swarm) to handle multiple code requests in parallel. The LLM-sandbox project itself supports Kubernetes for exactly this purpose.
Language Choices for Generated Code
While the models themselves may run in Python, the code they generate need not be. In theory, supporting multiple languages (JavaScript, C++, etc.) could allow the agent to pick the best tool for the job. In practice, however, most LLMs have a strong bias toward Python. A recent study found that when not told which language to use, LLMs chose Python in 90–97% of benchmark problems, and still 58% even when Python was suboptimal. This suggests that as a first approach, focusing on Python may yield the most reliable results (the model is most “comfortable” writing Python, and Python’s ecosystem suits math, data, and scripting). Offering other languages could still be useful: for example, JavaScript (Node) can run in a quick V8 sandbox or handle web APIs, C++ could be faster for heavy compute, and R is good for statistics. If you go multi-language, the sandbox must have images for each (LLM Sandbox supports this). One could even have the agent try solving in two languages and compare, but that doubles effort. For a solo prototype, I’d recommend starting with Python and maybe one other (like JavaScript) for tasks where they clearly dominate. Over time, you can benchmark a few tasks in Python vs. another language to see if any performance gain offsets the complexity. The study above suggests that even languages’ library choices follow similar biases (LLMs tend to use the most common libraries they’ve seen).
Benchmarks and Evaluation
To prove that code-augmented reasoning helps, define clear benchmarks. NP-hard problems (TSP, graph coloring, SAT, knapsack) or complex math puzzles are good candidates, since a coding solution can often find the exact or near-exact answer and can be checked against optimal solutions. Evaluate the agent on a mix of such problems both with and without the code tool. For example, measure success rate and accuracy when the agent is allowed to generate and run code versus when it just outputs text answers. Existing benchmarks like Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE) cover diverse reasoning tasks; OpenAI reported that using their Code Interpreter improved scores on HLE. Similarly, the OR-LLM-Agent paper reports their approach solved a benchmark set of 83 OR problems with 100% pass rate, whereas baseline LLMs failed many. Aside from solution correctness, measure factors like time to solution, number of code iterations needed, and resource usage. For subcomponents (like the code execution engine), monitor sandbox startup time, execution time, and memory. Use automated testing: for each problem, have a ground-truth answer or a way to verify (unit tests, assertion checks). The AI agent’s output is then fed to those tests. Score the agent on pass/fail and final answer accuracy. Keep track of how often the agent’s first code attempt works versus needing repairs. This will highlight the value of the feedback loop.
Architecture and Tools
For a prototype, you can implement the LLM and orchestration in Python. Use existing open-source frameworks where possible. For example, LLM-Sandbox (vndee/llm-sandbox) is an MIT-licensed Python library to securely run LLM-generated code in Docker or Kubernetes, with multi-language support, on-the-fly dependency installation, and file I/O. It integrates with Python (you can call it from your agent code) and even has a “fast mode” to skip some setup steps. Other components to consider:
A prompt manager that handles multi-role conversation (system prompt for agent role, user prompt for task, assistant prompt for LLM answer) as OR-LLM-Agent does.
A tool-integration layer (e.g. Model-Context-Protocol or an MCP server) that exposes web search, file retrieval, etc. as callable functions.
If building from scratch, simple Python wrappers for Google Search (or Bing), for StackOverflow API, and for documentation sites (maybe via requests and parsing) can suffice.
Language Server integration (like running pyls or clangd) is advanced but could be skipped initially. Instead, rely on linters and type checkers in the sandbox. The key is iterative testing with execution feedback. For orchestration, you might initially handle everything in one process (the LLM calls Python functions that manage Docker). Later, you could separate concerns (LLM microservice, sandbox microservice, etc.) or even deploy parts in the cloud. On hardware: start with a capable desktop or workstation (your own computer), which may be enough for early tests. Containers are memory-hungry, so a machine with 16-32GB RAM would help. If you outgrow it, consider renting cloud VMs or using a small Kubernetes cluster for the sandbox workers. CPU will likely be the bottleneck for code execution (especially if many runs), whereas the LLM (if using a local model) might use GPU. AWS EC2 or Google Cloud could host the sandbox if needed, but they may charge for idle Docker images. A hybrid approach is possible: run the LLM locally and remote-execute code via a MCP server on another machine or cloud container, to distribute load.
Open-Source Resources and Next Steps
Many of the ideas above are being explored in the current research and open-source community:
LLM-based code agents: The survey by Dong et al. (2025) outlines how code-generation agents autonomously plan, write code, debug, and iterate【11†L107-114】. It confirms that the trend is toward agents simulating a full developer workflow (analyzing requirements, writing code, running tests, fixing errors)【11†L107-114】. Studying such literature gives design ideas (for example, CodeAct’s integration of an interpreter to adjust actions on-the-fly).
Sandbox tools: LLM Sandbox, Windmill’s nsjail, gVisor, or even Firecracker microVMs (used by AWS Lambda) can isolate code. Review “Awesome Code Sandboxing” lists to pick an isolation approach. Cloudflare’s technique of running user code in a locked V8 isolate is elegant for JavaScript, but for Python you’ll use containers.
Agent frameworks: Tools like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, or LangGraph provide scaffolding for multi-step reasoning. While many are general, they support hooking up custom tools (like code exec). See discussions like OpenAI’s Responses API (which now includes a Code Interpreter tool).
Benchmarks: Look for existing code-generation evaluation suites (some are emerging around Code LLMs). The OR-LLM-Agent benchmark (83 problems) is available, and Humanity’s Last Exam is public. Use those plus classic algorithmic puzzles.
In summary, building an AI agent that “thinks with code” involves: identifying code-suitable tasks, training/promoting code-based reasoning, breaking problems into functions, executing and verifying code in a sandbox, using tools (search, docs) when needed, and iterating on solutions. By combining these elements in a systematic, feedback-driven pipeline – and measuring against benchmarks – you can create a robust prototype that goes beyond plain-text LLM answers. Wherever possible, leverage open-source tools (like LLM-sandbox for execution) and existing research on agent architectures【11†L107-114】 to accelerate development. Sources: Research on code-augmented reasoning and agents【11†L107-114】; OR-LLM-Agent example system; OpenAI tool integration updates; sandboxing (LLM-sandbox) documentation; code agent surveys; and programming language bias studies. These sources provide evidence and guidance for each component discussed.

By combining these elements in a systematic, feedback-driven pipeline – and measuring against benchmarks – you can create a robust prototype that goes beyond plain-text LLM answers. Wherever possible, leverage open-source tools (like LLM-sandbox for execution) and existing research on agent architectures【11†L107-114】 to accelerate development. Sources: Research on code-augmented reasoning and agents【11†L107-114】; OR-LLM-Agent example system; OpenAI tool integration updates; sandboxing (LLM-sandbox) documentation; code agent surveys; and programming language bias studies. These sources provide evidence and guidance for each component discussed.
